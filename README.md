# Supply_Chain_Optimization


### Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of a comprehensive supply chain analysis performed on a synthesized dataset representing key supply chain factors such as supplier delivery times, production costs, logistics costs, and demand-supply dynamics. The goal was to identify potential bottlenecks and suggest improvements to enhance efficiency and reduce overall costs.


### Data Overview

The dataset includes 1,000 records covering various aspects of the supply chain, including supplier delivery times, production and logistics costs, demand, lead times, safety stock levels, order quantities, delivery frequency, and warehouse storage costs.


### Key Analyses and Findings

  #### 1. Demand and Supply Analysis
  
      - The comparison between demand, order quantities, and safety stock levels indicates a general alignment between order quantities and demand, though some discrepancies suggest instances of       
        overordering or underordering.
      - Safety stock levels vary significantly across products, indicating potential overinvestment in some cases.


  #### 2. Cost Analysis
  
      - Production costs vary widely, suggesting diverse manufacturing complexities.
      - Logistics costs also show variability, potentially due to differences in transportation requirements or distances.
      - Some products have significantly higher production and logistics costs, impacting profitability.


  #### 3. Lead Time Analysis
  
      - Lead times vary across products, affecting the supply chain's responsiveness.
      - Products with longer lead times could hinder the supply chain's ability to adapt to market changes.


  #### 4. Bottleneck Identification
  
      - High Lead Time Products: Identified 211 products with lead times longer than the 75th percentile.
      - High Production Cost Products: 250 products fall into the top 25% of production costs.
      - High Logistics Cost Products: 250 products in the top quartile for logistics costs.
      - Demand-Order Quantity Mismatch: Significant mismatches observed in 906 products.


  #### 5. Improvement Suggestions
  
      - Optimize lead times through process improvements or alternative production strategies.
      - Review high-cost products to identify cost-reduction opportunities.
      - Align order quantities more closely with demand to reduce inventory costs.
      - Optimize safety stock levels to free up capital and storage space.
      - Explore logistics optimizations like bulk shipping or consolidated shipments.


### Visualizations and Interpretations

Scatter plots and density distributions were used to visualize the data. Key visualizations include comparisons of demand, order quantities, and safety stock, as well as production and logistics costs. A critical scatter plot highlighted products with high lead times and high production costs, pinpointing them as areas for immediate improvement.


### Conclusions and Recommendations

- The analysis has revealed several potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization. By addressing these, the company can significantly enhance its supply chain efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Key - 
  recommendations include:
- Focusing on products with high lead times and high costs for immediate improvements.
- Balancing efforts to reduce lead times with cost considerations to ensure overall profitability.
- Continuously monitoring and adjusting safety stock and order quantities to align with dynamic demand.


### Next Steps

Further investigation into specific high-cost and high-lead-time products is recommended to identify the underlying causes and develop targeted strategies for improvement. Regular reviews of supply chain performance metrics should be instituted to maintain optimal efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
