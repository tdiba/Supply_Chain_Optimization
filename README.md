### Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of supply chain data to identify bottlenecks and suggest improvements to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. The dataset includes 1,000 records covering various aspects of the supply chain such as supplier delivery times, production costs, logistics costs, demand, lead times, safety stock levels, order quantities, delivery frequency, and warehouse storage costs.


### Data Overview

The dataset includes 1,000 records covering various aspects of the supply chain, including supplier delivery times, production and logistics costs, demand, lead times, safety stock levels, order quantities, delivery frequency, and warehouse storage costs.


### Key Analyses and Findings

  #### 1. Demand and Supply Analysis
  
      - The comparison between demand, order quantities, and safety stock levels indicates a general alignment between order quantities and demand, though some discrepancies suggest instances of       
        overordering or underordering.
      - Safety stock levels vary significantly across products, indicating potential overinvestment in some cases.


  #### 2. Cost Analysis
  
      - Production costs vary widely, suggesting diverse manufacturing complexities.
      - Logistics costs also show variability, potentially due to differences in transportation requirements or distances.
      - Some products have significantly higher production and logistics costs, impacting profitability.


  #### 3. Lead Time Analysis
  
      - Lead times vary across products, affecting the supply chain's responsiveness.
      - Products with longer lead times could hinder the supply chain's ability to adapt to market changes.


  #### 4. Bottleneck Identification
  
      - High Lead Time Products: Identified 211 products with lead times longer than the 75th percentile.
      - High Production Cost Products: 250 products fall into the top 25% of production costs.
      - High Logistics Cost Products: 250 products in the top quartile for logistics costs.
      - Demand-Order Quantity Mismatch: Significant mismatches observed in 906 products.


  #### 5. Improvement Suggestions
  
      - Optimize lead times through process improvements or alternative production strategies.
      - Review high-cost products to identify cost-reduction opportunities.
      - Align order quantities more closely with demand to reduce inventory costs.
      - Optimize safety stock levels to free up capital and storage space.
      - Explore logistics optimizations like bulk shipping or consolidated shipments.
      


### Recommendations

- Optimize lead times and production processes.
- Align order quantities with demand to reduce inventory costs.
- Review and reduce high production and logistics costs.
- Optimize safety stock levels to free up capital and storage space.
- Explore logistics optimizations like bulk shipping or consolidated shipments.


### Conclusion

This analysis provides actionable insights for improving supply chain efficiency and cost-effectiveness, supporting strategic decision-making and operational improvements.
